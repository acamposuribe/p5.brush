# p5.brush.js

p5.brush.js is a versatile library for the p5.js ecosystem, tailored for artists, designers, and hobbyists who wish to explore natural textures in generative art. This library extends the drawing capabilities of p5.js by introducing a rich set of tools that allow for the creation of dynamic and customizable brushes, vector-fields, and fill modes.

With p5.brush.js, you can easily configure and manage intricate drawing systems, inject life into your sketches with organic movements, and apply complex vector fields to control the flow and form of strokes. The library is designed with texture quality in mind, and may only be suitable for high-resolution artworks, not real-time interactive pieces.

Whether you're looking to simulate natural media, create patterned backgrounds, or design intricate particle systems, p5.brush.js offers the functionalities to turn your vision into reality. The API is straightforward and modular, providing both high-level functions for quick setup and in-depth customization options for advanced users.

Embrace the full potential of your creative coding projects with p5.brush.js, where every stroke is a brush with possibility.

## Installation

Important note: p5.brush requires p5.js 1.11 or higher. 

### Local Installation

To set up your project, add `p5.min.js` `p5.brush.js` to your HTML file. You can download the last version of the p5.brush.js library in the [dist](/dist) folder.
Place the script tags in the following order:

```html
<!-- Commented version of p5.brush.js, with a Spectral.js dependency -->
<script src="path_to/p5.min.js"></script>
<script src="path_to/p5.brush.js"></script>
```
Replace path_to with the actual path to the script in your project directory or the URL if you are using a CDN.

### Use a hosted version of the p5.brush.js library 

Alternatively, you can link to a `p5.brush.js` file hosted online. All versions are stored in a CDN (Content Delivery Network). You can find a history of these versions in the p5.js CDN. In this case you can change the link to:

```html
<!-- Online version of p5.brush -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5.brush"></script>
```

### Install with NPM and other modular-based apps

Install the npm package. p5.brush requires p5.js as a peer dependency.

```
npm install p5.brush --save
```

After that, import p5.brush functions to your sketch:

```
import * as brush from 'p5.brush'
```

If you are using p5 and p5.brush as modules, you will need to use instance mode. Read below.


### Note for p5 instance mode

By default, all p5.js functions are in the global namespace (i.e. bound to the window object), meaning you can call them simply ellipse(), fill(), etc. However, this might be inconvenient if you are mixing with other JS libraries (synchronously or asynchronously) or writing long programs of your own. p5.js currently supports a way around this problem called "instance mode". In instance mode, all p5 functions are bound up in a single variable instead of polluting your global namespace. 

If you plan to use p5 instance mode, you need to load p5.brush in a specific way:

- Use `brush.instance()` before the setup and draw functions, pointing to your sketch id and the p5 function argument

  Example:

  ```javascript
  let sketch = function(p) {
    let x = 100;
    let y = 100;

    // Register instance method here, sending your function arg p
    brush.instance(p)

    p.setup = function() {
      // Important to create the canvas in WEBGL mode
      p.createCanvas(700, 410, p.WEBGL);
      // Don't forget to load the library after canvas is created
      brush.load()
    };

    p.draw = function() {
      p.background(0);
      brush.fill("red", 75);
      brush.rect(x, y, 50, 50);
    };
  };

  let myp5 = new p5(sketch);
  ```

### Utility Functions

---
 
- `brush.push()`
  - **Description**: The push() function saves the current brush, hatch, and fill settings and transformations, while pop() restores these settings. Note that these functions are always used together.

- `brush.pop()`
  - **Description**: The push() function saves the current brush, hatch, and fill settings and transformations, while pop() restores these settings. Note that these functions are always used together.

---

- `brush.rotate(angle)`
  - **Description**: Rotates following shapes by the amount specified by the angle parameter. This function accounts for angleMode(), so angles can be entered in either RADIANS or DEGREES. Objects are always rotated around their relative position to the origin and positive numbers rotate objects in an anti-clockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulate the effect. This function can be further controlled by brush.push() and brush.pop().

---

- `brush.scale(scale)`
  - **Description**: Increases or decreases the size of shapes and strokes by expanding or contracting vertices. Objects always scale from their relative origin to the coordinate system. Scale values are specified as decimal percentages. For example, the function call scale(2.0) increases the dimension of a shape by 200%. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function multiply the effect. For example, calling scale(2.0) and then scale(1.5) is the same as scale(3.0).

---

- `brush.reDraw()`
  - **Description**: p5.brush uses several buffers and caches to make the drawing operations more performant. Use the reDraw() function if you want to force noBlend brushes to be drawn into the canvas. This function is designed to help maintain the correct draw order for the different strokes and shapes.

- `brush.reBlend()`
  - **Description**: p5.brush uses several buffers and caches to make the drawing operations more performant. Use the reDraw() function if you want to force Blend brushes to be drawn into the canvas. This function is designed to help maintain the correct draw order for the different strokes and shapes.

### Vector Fields

Vector Fields allow for dynamic control over brush stroke behavior, enabling the creation of complex and fluid motion within sketches.


 #### Basic vector-field functions

---
 
- `brush.field(name)`
  - **Description**: Activates a named vector field. When a vector field is active, it influences the flow and direction of the brush strokes for shapes drawn thereafter. It is important to note that certain shapes may be exempt from this influence; such exceptions will be clearly documented in the API for each specific geometry.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `name` (String): The identifier for the vector field to be activated. This can be a name of one of the predefined fields or a custom field created with `brush.addField()`.
  - **Default Fields**: The library comes with a set of built-in vector fields: `curved`, `truncated`, `zigzag`, `seabed`, and `waves`. These, as well as any custom fields added, can be activated using this function.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // To activate the "waves" vector field
    brush.field("waves");

    // To activate a custom vector field named "myCustomField"
    brush.field("myCustomField");
    ```
    Once a vector field is activated, it affects how the subsequent shapes are drawn, aligning them with its directional flow, unless stated otherwise in the documentation

---

- `brush.noField()`
  - **Description**: Deactivates the currently active vector field, returning the drawing behavior to its default state where shapes are not influenced by any vector field. Any shapes drawn after this function call will not be affected by the previously active vector field.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Deactivate the current vector field
    brush.noField();
    ```
    Use this function when you want to draw shapes that are unaffected by the directional flow of any vector field, effectively resetting the drawing behavior to its original state.

---

- `brush.refreshField(time)`
  - **Description**: Updates the current vector field values using its time-dependent generator function. Ideal for animations that require the vector field to change over time, influencing the movement of strokes and shapes in a natural way.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `time` (Number): The time input for the vector field generator function, typically related to the frame count.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // In the draw loop, refresh the vector field based on the frame count
    function draw() {
      brush.refreshField(frameCount / 10);
      // Additional drawing code
    }
    ```
    This function will invoke the generator function of the active vector field with the provided time argument, allowing the field to evolve and create fluid, dynamic animations in the rendering.

---

- `brush.listFields()`
  - **Description**: Retrieves an iterator containing the names of all the available vector fields within the system. This includes both the default fields provided by the library and any custom fields that have been added using `brush.addField()`.
  - **Returns**: `Iterator<string>` - An iterator that yields the names of the vector fields.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Get an iterator of all vector field names
    let fieldNames = brush.listFields();
    // Loop through the names using the iterator
    for (let name of fieldNames) {
      console.log(name);
    }
    ```
    Use `brush.listFields()` to access the names of all existing vector fields, which can then be used to activate or modify fields as needed.

---
 
 #### Advanced vector-field functions

---

- `brush.addField(name, generatorFunction)`
  - **Description**: Adds a custom vector field to the list of available fields. This advanced function requires a unique name for the field and a generator function that defines the behavior of the vector field over time.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `name` (String): A unique identifier for the vector field.
    - `generatorFunction` (Function): A function that generates the field values. It takes a time parameter `t`, loops through the vector field cells, assigns angular values based on custom logic, and returns the modified `field` array.
  - **Default Fields**: The library includes several pre-defined vector fields. Users can add their own to extend the functionality.
  - **Usage**: To add a vector field that creates wave-like motions:
    ```javascript
    brush.addField("waves", function(t, field) {
        let sinrange = random(10,15) + 5 * sin(t);
        let cosrange = random(3,6) + 3 * cos(t);
        let baseAngle = random(20,35);
        for (let column = 0; column < field.length; column++) {
            for (let row = 0; row < field[0].length; row++) {               
                let angle = sin(sinrange * column) * (baseAngle * cos(row * cosrange)) + random(-3,3);
                field[column][row] = angle;
            }
        }
        return field;
    });
    ```
    - **Note**: It's important that your loops create a grid of `field.length` x `field[0].length`. It's necessary to fill all the `field` cells with a numeric value. Return this array when you've filled the values. **The angles MUST BE in Degrees**.
    ```javascript
    brush.addField("name_field", function(t, field) {
        let field = FF.genField()
        // Related functions for angle calculation
        for (let i = 0; i < field.length; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < field[0].length; j++) {               
                // Related functions for angle calculation here
                field[i][j] = CalculatedAngle;
            }
        }
        return field;
    });
    ```

### Brush Management

Functions for managing brush behaviors and properties.

---

- `brush.box()`
  - **Description**: Retrieves an array containing the unique names of all available brushes. This function is useful for accessing the variety of brushes included in the library, which range from different pencil types to markers and specialized brushes like the hatch brush. Of course, the function will also return the custom brushes you've created.
  - **Returns**: `Array<string>` - An array listing the names of all brushes.
  - **Default Brushes**: The library includes a default set of 11 brushes: `2B`, `HB`, `2H`, `cpencil`, `pen`, `rotring`, `spray`, `marker`, `marker2`, `charcoal`, and `hatch_brush` (for clean hatching).
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Retrieve a list of all available brush names
    let brushes = brush.box();
    console.log(brushes); // Logs the array of brush names
    ```
    `brush.box()` allows you to explore and select from the various brushes, facilitating the choice of the appropriate brush for different artistic needs.

---

- `brush.add(name, params)`
  - **Description**: Adds a new brush to the brush list with specified parameters, defining the brush's behavior and appearance. This function allows for extensive customization, enabling the creation of unique brush types suited to various artistic needs.

            min_max: [1.35,1],
            curve: [0.35,0.25] // Values for the bell curve
        },
        tip: (_m) => {
           // in this example, the tip is composed of two squares, rotated 45 degrees
           // Always execute drawing functions within the _m buffer!
           _m.rotate(45), _m.rect(-1.5,-1.5,3,3), _m.rect(1,1,1,1);
        },
        rotate: "natural",
    })
    ```
    By using `brush.add()`, you can expand your brush collection with custom brushes tailored to specific artistic effects and styles.

---

- `brush.clip(clippingRegion)`
  - **Description**: Sets a rectangular clipping region for all subsequent brush strokes. When this clipping region is active, brush strokes outside this area will not be rendered. This is particularly useful for ensuring that strokes, such as lines and curves, are contained within a specified area. The clipping affects only stroke and hatch operations, not fill operations. The clipping remains in effect for all strokes drawn after the call to `brush.clip()` until `brush.noClip()` is used.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `clippingRegion` (Array): An array defining the clipping region as `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, with `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` being the corners of the clipping rectangle.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Set a clipping region
    brush.clip([10, 10, 250, 200]);
    // Draw a line - it will be clipped according to the region
    brush.line(100, 90, 300, 40);

    // Remove the clipping region
    brush.noClip();
    // Draw another line - it will not be clipped
    brush.line(0, 0, 200, 300);
    ```

---

- `brush.noClip()`
  - **Description**: Disables the current clipping region, allowing subsequent brush strokes to be drawn across the entire canvas without being clipped. Use this function to revert to the default state where strokes are unrestricted.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Disable the clipping region
    brush.noClip();
    ```

### Fill Operations

The Fill Management section focuses on managing fill properties for shapes, enabling complex fill operations with effects like bleeding to simulate watercolor-like textures. These methods set fill colors with opacity, control bleed intensity, and manage fill operations. The watercolor fill effect is inspired by Tyler Hobbs' generative art techniques.

** IMPORTANT: ** At the moment, fill operations expect an array of vertices in the clockwise direction. Otherwise, the fill will "bleed" to the inside, destroying the effect. I'll try to fix this on a forthcoming update.

---

In essence, the hatching system activates hatches for subsequent shapes, similarly to stroke and fill operations. However, you can also directly hatch multiple objects at once (and their intersections), if you proceed as described below
.

- `brush.hatchArray(polygons)`
  - **Description**: Creates a hatching pattern across specified polygons. This function applies the set hatching parameters to a single polygon or an array of polygons.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `polygons` (Array|Object): The polygon(s) to apply the hatching. Can be a single polygon object or an array of polygon objects.
  - **Note**: This is not the main, but an alternative way of applying hatches. Read above.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Define an array of polygons (reference in the classes section)
    let myPolygons = []
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       // We're creating 10 random triangles here
    			let p = new brush.Polygon([
          [random(width), random(height)],
          [random(width), random(height)],
          [random(width), random(height)],  
       ])
       myPolygons.push(p)
    }
    // Create hatching across specified polygons
    brush.hatchArray(myPolygons);
    ```
    `brush.hatchArray()` provides an efficient way to apply complex hatching patterns to a set of defined shapes.

    brush.flowLine(15, 10, 185, 0);
    ```

---

These three functions provide advanced control over the creation of strokes/paths, allowing for custom pressure and direction at different points along the path. This is a strange way of defining strokes, but intuitive when you think of them as bodily movements performed with the hands. You can create two types of strokes: "curve" or "segments". For curved strokes, the curvature at any point of the stroke is lerped between the nearest control points.

These functions allow for the creation of strokes with varied pressures and directions, mimicking the organic nature of hand-drawn strokes. For an application of these principles, see: [Enfantines II](https://art.arqtistic.com/Enfantines-2)

- `brush.beginStroke(type, x, y)`
  - **Description**: Initializes a new stroke, setting the type and starting position. The type determines the kind of Plot to create, either a "curve" or "segments".

  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Begin a new curve stroke
    brush.beginStroke("curve", 15, 30);
    ```

- `brush.segment(angle, length, pressure)`
  - **Description**: Adds a segment to the stroke, defining its path by specifying the angle, length, and pressure. This function is used after `brush.beginStroke()` and before `brush.endStroke()` to outline the stroke's trajectory and characteristics.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `angle` (Number): The initial angle of the segment, relative to the canvas, measured anticlockwise from the x-axis.
    - `length` (Number): The length of the segment.
    - `pressure` (Number): The pressure at the start of the segment, influencing properties like width.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Add two segments to the stroke
    brush.segment(30, 150, 0.6);
    brush.segment(75, 40, 1.1);
    ```

- `brush.endStroke(angle, pressure)`
  - **Description**: Completes the stroke path and triggers its rendering. This function defines the angle and pressure at the last point of the stroke path.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `angle` (Number): The angle of the curve at the end point of the stroke path.
    - `pressure` (Number): The pressure at the end of the stroke.

    brush.endStroke(-45, 0.8);
    ```

---

- `brush.spline(array_points, curvature)`
  - **Description**: Generates and draws a spline curve, a smooth curve defined by a series of control points. The curve connects the start and end points directly, using the other points in the array as control points to define the curve's path. The curvature parameter allows for adjusting the smoothness of the curve. Spline is maybe not the appropriate description, since these splines are basically segmented paths with rounded corners.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `array_points` (Array<Array<number>>): An array of points, where each point is an array of two numbers `[x, y]`.
    - `curvature` (Number): Optional. The curvature of the spline curve, ranging from 0 to 1. A curvature of 0 results in a series of straight segments.
  - **Note**: This is a simplified alternative to beginShape() - endShape() operations, useful for certain stroke() applications.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Define points for the spline curve
    let points = [[30, 70], [85, 20], [130, 100], [180, 50]];
    // Create a spline curve with a specified curvature
    brush.spline(points, 0.5);
    ```

---

- `brush.plot(p, x, y, scale)`

  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Define a plot (heart shape)
    let heart = new brush.Plot();
    // ... Define the heart plot here ...
    // Draw the heart shape with a flowing stroke
    brush.flowShape(heart, 200, 200, 1.3);
    ```

        // Load p5.brush again on global canvas
        brush.load()
      }
      ```
  - **Note for Instance Mode**: If you want to use the p5 instance mode, you need to pass the proper variable as canvasID.
      ```javascript
      let sketch = function(p) {
        let x = 100;
        let y = 100;

        // Register instance method here, sending your function arg p
        brush.instance(p)

        p.setup = function() {
          p.createCanvas(700, 410);
        };

        p.draw = function() {
          p.background(0);

- `brush.colorCache(bool = true)`
  - **Description**: Enables or disables color caching for WebGL shaders. Color caching can increase performance but may produce less accurate textures when the same color is used repeatedly. It's set to _true_ by default
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `bool` (boolean): Set to true to enable caching, or false to disable it.

- `brush.scaleBrushes(scale)`
  - **Description**: Adjusts the global scale of all standard brush parameters, including weight, vibration, and spacing, based on the given scaling factor. This function is specifically designed to affect default brushes only, allowing for uniform scaling across various brush types.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `scale` (Number): The scaling factor to be applied to the brush parameters.
  - **Note**: This function only impacts the default brushes. Custom brushes may not be affected by this scaling, since they are defined per case basis.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    // Scale all standard brushes by a factor of 1.5
    brush.scaleBrushes(1.5);
    ```
    Using `brush.scaleBrushes()`, you can easily adjust the size and spacing characteristics of standard brushes in your project, providing a convenient way to adapt to different canvas sizes or artistic styles.

- `brush.remove()`
  - **Description**: Removes brush library brushes and unloads the library. This can be useful if you only used the library to draw into a buffer, and you want to perform only normal p5 operations after that.
    
---

- `brush.instance(p)`
  - **Description**: Execute before the setup() and draw() functions if you need to use p5 in instance mode
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `p` (variable): Variable used as the function argument. See below
  - **Example**:
      ```javascript
      let sketch = function(p) {
        let x = 100;
        let y = 100;

        // Register instance method here, sending your function arg p
        brush.instance(p)

        p.setup = function() {
          p.createCanvas(700, 410);
        };

        p.draw = function() {
          p.background(0);
          brush.fill("red", 75);
          brush.rect(x, y, 50, 50);
        };
      };

      let myp5 = new p5(sketch);
      ```

  - `.intersect(line)`
    - Intersects the polygon with a given line, returning all intersection points.
    - Parameters:
      - `line` (Object): A line object with properties `point1` and `point2`.
    - Returns: `Array` of objects, each with `x` and `y` properties, representing the intersection points.
  - `.draw(brush, color, weight)`
    - Draws the polygon on the canvas, following the current stroke state or the provided params.
  - `.fill(color, opacity, bleed, texture)`
    - Fills the polygon on the canvas, adhering to the current fill state or to the provided params.
  - `.hatch(distance, angle, options)`
    - Applies hatching to the polygon on the canvas, based on the current hatch state or the provided params.

- **Attributes**:
  - `.vertices`: An array of the polygon's vertices, each vertex being an object with `x` and `y` properties.
  - `.sides`: An array representing the different segments that make up the polygon.

#### Class: `brush.Plot`

- **Description**: The `Plot` class is crucial for the plot system, managing a collection of segments to create a variety of shapes and paths. It enables intricate designs, such as curves and custom strokes, by defining each segment with an angle, length, and pressure. `Plot` instances can be transformed through rotation, and their appearance controlled via pressure and angle calculations.

- **Constructor**:
  - `brush.Plot(_type)`
    - `_type` (String): The type of plot, either "curve" or "segments".

- **Methods**:
  - `.addSegment(_a, _length, _pres)`
    - Adds a segment to the plot.
    - Parameters:
      - `_a` (Number): The angle of the segment.
      - `_length` (Number): The length of the segment.
      - `_pres` (Number): The pressure of the segment.
  - `.endPlot(_a, _pres)`
    - Finalizes the plot with the last angle and pressure.
    - Parameters:
      - `_a` (Number): The final angle of the plot.
      - `_pres` (Number): The final pressure of the plot.
  - `.rotate(_a)`
    - Rotates the entire plot by a specified angle.
    - Parameters:
      - `_a` (Number): The angle for rotation.
  - `.genPol(_x, _y)`
    - Generates a polygon based on the plot.
